Ansible Role loki_compose
=========

Ansible role to deploy production-ready (**as in** fully configured and safely architected/deployed ready-to-use unit - **not as in** scalable, elastic and highly-available architecture. There are [other setup options](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/) and [deployment modes](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/fundamentals/architecture/deployment-modes/) that are more sophisticated and should be considered) Loki environments with Docker Compose.

The deployed environment includes Loki, Grafana and Alertmanager services as well as (optional, enabled by default) nginx-proxy and ACME services to provide a proxied, SSL-enabled web interface for Grafana. In every case, there exists only two containers with network bindings to the host-side (Loki and Grafana/nginx-proxy), all other communication is handled solely within the docker network that is set up by the compose file.

While the the services itself are stateless in a sense that configuration is completely handled by the provided configuration options (and the generated configurations are bound read-only within the container), you can individually configure bind-mounts for Grafana (settings, dashboards, users, ...) and Loki (mostly index and chunk data if you're using a filesystem backend) in case you want to persist or back up the corresponding data locally.

**Note:**
* The username of the built-in Grafana admin user is set to 'grafana_admin' (which differs from the default 'admin')
* Anonymous access is disabled for Grafana

Requirements
------------

This role does not take care of docker installation or configuration but relies on a working docker setup on the host. You may want to have a look at the [ansible docker role from geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker) for an easy way to ensure such an installation on the targets as well as the configuration variables regarding te docker command for this role below.

Role Variables
--------------

All variables used within this role (internal ones as well as defaults meant to be overriden) start with an *lc_* prefix. Below is a list of all default variables that can be used to configure the resulting deployment.

| Variable                  | Default value and explanation |
|---                        |---                                  |
| lc_base_directory         | */srv* ‚Äî Base directory for the deployment of the compose fileset (which will be placed in *{{lc_base_directory}}/LokiCompose/*) |
| lc_service_user           | *root* ‚Äî The user that will be owner of the deployment files and run the containers (will also be set in systemd service, if enabled) |
| lc_compose_major_version  | *2* ‚Äî Major version of the compose installation. This setting also determines the binary command (*docker-compose* vs. *docker compose*) embedded in the systemd service, if enabled |
| lc_docker_bin_dir         | *None* ‚Äì If left empty, docker binary path will be automatically determined at runtime of the play |
| lc_loki_bind_addresses    | *['127.0.0.1']* ‚Äî Bind address(es) for the port definition of the Loki container. Port is fixed on 3100 |
| lc_grafana_bind_address   | *127.0.0.1* ‚Äî Bind address for the port definition of the Grafana container. Port is fixed on 3000. Will only take effect if *lc_enable_acme_proxy* is disabled, otherwise Grafana container is **not** bound to the host side and only exposed within the compose network |
| lc_grafana_vhost          | *grafana.example.tld* ‚Äî domain record to be used for the virtual host definition of the proxy and ACME services, if enabled. Unused otherwise |
| lc_grafana_password       | *p@ssword_to_be_replaced* ‚Äî self-explanatory |
| lc_enable_acme_proxy      | *true* ‚Äî Enable or disable generation of proxy and ACME container services. If disabled, the Grafana container will be bound to the host interface directly (see also *lc_grafana_bind_address*) |
| lc_nginx_no_robots        | *true* ‚Äî Enable or disable X-Robots-Tag header containing 'noindex, nofollow, nosnippet, noarchive' |
| lc_nginx_bind_address     | *0.0.0.0* ‚Äî Bind address for the port defiition of the nginx proxy container. Ports are fixed to 80 and 443 |
| lc_letsencrypt_test_mode  | *true* ‚Äî Enable or disable the staging mode of the ACME service. When enabled, the Let's Encrypt staging URL is used and resulting certificates will generate a browser warning |
| lc_acme_mail              | *admin@example.tld* ‚Äî The contact email that is used during the registration process of new certificates from Let's Encrypt |
| lc_alertmanager_default_receiver  | *black-hole* ‚Äî Default receiver to use for unmatched alerts. *black-hole* is a dummy receiver without any action and is only generated when no other receivers are defined (see *lc_alertmanager_receivers*) |
| lc_alertmanager_receivers | *None* ‚Äî Receiver configuration(s) for Alertmanager. See the [Alertmanager documentation on receiver configurations](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#receiver) as well as the [Alertmanager example configuration](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/main/doc/examples/simple.yml). Each receiver needs a unique name (which can in turn be set as *lc_alertmanager_default_receiver* and a corresponding config element) |
| lc_service_manage         | *false* ‚Äî Enable or disable service creation and state control for systemd. The service name is loki-compose |
| lc_service_state          | *started* ‚Äî Set the desired service state to ensure. Possible values are 'started', 'stopped', 'restarted' and 'reloaded' |
| lc_service_enabled        | *true* ‚Äî Enable or disable the systemd service to run at startup |
| lc_loki_bind_mount_dir    | *None* ‚Äî Host directory to use for bind mount volume of the Loki containers data directory. If unset or empty, no named or bind mount volume will be created |
| lc_grafana_bind_mount_dir | *None* ‚Äî Host directory to use for bind mount volume of the Grafana containers data directory. If unset or empty, no named or bind mount volume will be created |
| lc_nginx_log_bind_mount_dir | *None* ‚Äî Host directory to use for bind mount volume of the nginx containers log directory. If unset or empty, no named or bind mount volume will be created |

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

With a working docker compose (v2) setup on the target, the shortest (but by relying solely on default values neither highly useful nor secure) example to test this role out would simply be:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
        - role: dominiquefuchs.loki_compose
          vars:
            lc_enable_acme_proxy: false

---

For a more customized and useful environment, one may want to

- specify a service user to use (must exist and be a member of the docker group)
- set the bind address of Loki to an internal interfaces IP (in the example below, 'internal_interface' is a variable definition that may be set on the host within the inventory, e.g. 'ens10')
- set the vhost / target domain for the Grafana server (with a corresponding DNS record pointing to your targets address)
- provide an own password for the grafana_admin
- disable test (staging) mode for Let's Encrypt and provide a valid contact email
- install the systemd service and ensure it is enabled and immediately started
- define a receiver for alertmanager and set it as default receiver - the example below configures a Telegram bot/channel (the correct URL would be *https://api.telegram.org* - just put a fake tld there to prevent spamming from copy/paste startups)
 
Which gives:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
        - role: dominiquefuchs.loki_compose
          vars:
            lc_service_user: loki
            lc_grafana_vhost: your.domain.tld
            lc_loki_bind_addresses: ['{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]["ansible_"~internal_interface].ipv4.address }}']
            lc_grafana_password: 'l3A6MN94$BGq'
            lc_letsencrypt_test_mode: false
            lc_acme_mail: 'yourname@example.tld'
            lc_service_manage: true
            lc_alertmanager_default_receiver: test-receiver
            lc_alertmanager_receivers:
              - name: test-receiver
                telegram_configs:
                  - bot_token: '123456'
                    send_resolved: true
                    api_url: 'https://api.telegram.example'
                    chat_id: 123456
                    parse_mode: ''
